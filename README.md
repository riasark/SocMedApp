# Installation Instructions
Installing the project is an easy and efficient, just follow the steps below. 

## 1. Copy the _HTTPS link_ for the repo
Click on the <> Code symbol on the right-hand side, in green

## 2. Clone the repo into your local space 
Using the _git clone_ command, you can clone the repo locally with the HTTPS link you copied from the last step 

## 3. Open the cloned repo 
If you didn't rename the folder which you git cloned, you should have a folder called **_SocMedApp_** inside of the directory that you cloned the folder into. Open this folder in VSCode. You can do so by using the _cd_ command to enter the folder, and then typing _code ._, or you can simply open the folder through VSCode's GUI. Whatever works best for you!

## 4. Running the frontend and the backend
Once you've opened the folder inside your VSCode, open two terminals. On one terminal, change directory into the client folder to enter the frontend side of the code using this command: _cd client_. In the other terminal, change directory into the server folder to enter the backend side of the code using this command: _cd server_. 

In the terminal that is on the backend folder (server), type the command _npm install_ to install all the node packages that are necessary to run the server. Then, you can type the command _node server.js_, in order to create the connection with the database that our website is using. 

In the terminal that is on the frontend folder (client), type the command _npm install_ to install all the node packages that are necessary to run the client-side. Then, you can type the command _npm run start_, in order to see the user interface and interact with it. 

## 5. Localhost
Navigate to **localhost:3000/login** in order to find the login page for our site. 

**_If possible, visit the localhost on safari rather than Chrome. It works and looks better._**

## 6. Additional Information **(PLEASE READ)**
Please make the website full screen to be able to view all the UI components properly! 
Additionally, make sure your computer is on light mode when you view the website, dark 
mode exists for our website but the light mode looks exponentially better and it is easier to see.
